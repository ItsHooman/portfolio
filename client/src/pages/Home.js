    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
  Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack developer who enjoys transforming ideas into clean, interactive digital
  experiences. My core expertise lies in <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and modern
  <strong> JavaScript</strong>, but Iâ€™m equally comfortable working across the full web stack â€” from crafting
  responsive front-end interfaces to designing robust RESTful and GraphQL backends.
  <br /><br />
  I completed the <strong>3-year Computer Programming &amp; Analysis</strong> program at
  <strong> George Brown College</strong> in Toronto, where I built a strong foundation in software engineering,
  data structures, and UI/UX principles. During my studies, I developed multiple full-stack projects, including
  <strong> TripMate</strong> â€” a travel companion platform that connects solo travelers based on shared goals
  and experiences. That project deepened my love for scalable app design and real-world problem solving.
  <br /><br />
  Beyond technical skills, I value <strong>clarity, accessibility,</strong> and
  <strong> performance</strong> in everything I build. Iâ€™m passionate about clean design, semantic code, and
  creating web applications that donâ€™t just function well but also <em>feel right</em> to use.
  <br /><br />
  I currently live in Toronto, constantly learning and experimenting with emerging web technologies, cloud
  deployment, and creative front-end animation techniques. My goal is to continue growing as a developer while
  collaborating on projects that merge creativity, technology, and purpose.
